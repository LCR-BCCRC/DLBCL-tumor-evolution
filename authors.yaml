abstract:
  [
    "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is cured in over 60% of patients, but outcomes are poor for patients with relapsed or refractory disease (rrDLBCL). Here, we performed whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) on tumors from 73 serially-biopsied patients with rrDLBCL. Based on the observation that outcomes to salvage therapy/autologous stem cell transplantation are related to time-to-relapse, we stratified patients into groups according to relapse timing to explore the relationship to genetic divergence and sensitivity to salvage immunochemotherapy. The degree of mutational divergence increased with time between biopsies, yet tumor pairs were mostly concordant for cell-of-origin, oncogene rearrangement status and genetics-based subgroup. In patients with highly divergent tumors, several genes acquired exclusive mutations independently in each tumor, which, along with concordance of genetics-based subgroups, suggests that the earliest mutations in a shared precursor cell constrain tumor evolution. These results suggest that late relapses commonly represent genetically distinct and chemotherapy-na√Øve disease."

    "**Relationship between relapse timing and outcomes to salvage therapy.** **A, B.** The percent of patients in each relapse timing category whose relapse responded to salvage therapy (**A**) and who received ASCT (**B**). Groups were compared with pairwise Fisher's exact tests. **C-F.** Kaplan-Meier curves showing PFS and OS from the time of progression or ASCT. P-values were determined with a log-rank test. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001.",

    "**Sequencing cohort patient histories.** Disease and treatment histories for all known biopsies and progressions for patients for which WGS/WES data were generated, distributed according to relapse timing categories. Five patients were omitted due to incomplete histories. DLBCL tumors are colored according to NanoString COO where available or are otherwise labeled DLBCL-NOS (not otherwise specified). COMFL, composite lymphoma with areas of DLBCL and FL morphology; FL, follicular lymphoma; MZL, marginal zone lymphoma; MALT, extranodal MZL mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; HGBL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma; PROG, clinical progression without a biopsy. ",

    "**Patterns of evolution in diagnostic and relapse tumor pairs.** **A** Oncoplots of variants identified exclusively at diagnosis (top), relapse (bottom), or shared between biopsies (middle), highlighting the most frequently mutated genes involved in LymphGen classification. Patients are stratified by relapse timing and ordered by the mean percentage of exclusive variants. Barplots indicate the number of coding mutations present per patient in each mutation subset. **B** The relationship between total variants (all or coding only) at diagnosis or relapse vs. the number of mutations shared between tumors. The dashed grey line represents the line of unity. **C** The percent of variants exclusive to either diagnostic or relapse tumors as a function of time between biopsies. R represents the Pearson correlation coefficient. **D, E.** Concordance of heavy chain (**D**) and light chain (**E**) V gene usage derived from RNAseq data for tumor pairs colored by V gene subgroup. In all plots, alluvia connecting each tumor pair are opaque for discordant pairs and translucent for concordant pairs. *N.B.* Where V gene usage was discordant but both V genes belong to the same subgroup, the color is consistent across timepoints. ",

    "**Comparison of structural variants and GEP and genetic classifications between biopsies.** **A.** Concordance of BA-FISH results between diagnosis and first relapse for *MYC*, *BCL2*, and *BCL6* translocations. **B.** Circos plots showing discordant *MYC* translocations in two patients who experienced late relapse. Top: a tumor pair that was positive for BA-FISH at both timepoints; bottom: a tumor pair that was BA-FISH postive at diagnosis and negative at relapse. **C.** Alluvial comparison of COO classifications in diagnostic/relapse pairs stratified by relapse timing. Frank discordance (ABC to GCB or *vice versa*) is indicated by opaque alluvia. **D.** A scatter plot comparing DLBCL90 COO scores across tumor pairs. Red circles highlight frank discordance in COO classification. R values indicate Pearson correlation coefficient. **E.** Comparison of LymphGen classifications between tumor pairs. Frank discordance (a switch between two mutually exclusive non-Other classifications) is emphasized with opaque alluvia.  ",

    "**Representative phylogenetic reconstructions.**  Each row of plots displays data for a single patient. Tumors are labeled according to order of occurrence and LymphGen classification. Subclones are colored consistently across all plots for each patient. From left to right: Cancer cell fraction of subclones estimated by PhyClone; VAF of each variant as a scatter plot with the diagnostic tumor on the x-axis and relapse tumor on the y-axis with selected genes labeled; the fraction of mutations shared between both tumors (*i.e.* all mutations in a cluster with a CCF > 0.1); and the inferred phylogenetic relationship between tumors. Hotspot mutations at *MYD88* L265P and *CD79B* Y179 and missense mutations in the *CREBBP* lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain are indicated with an asterisk.", 
    
    "**Classification features in divergent tumor pairs.** **A.** LymphGen classification features that were mutated in two or more tumors from the same patient. Trunk variants (darkest) are identical in all tumors from the same patient; branch trunk are variants not shared across all tumors but are common between at least two; and exclusive are those found in only one tumor. Numbers on each bar represent the total number of variants considered in each feature. **B.** LymphGen classification features that acquired exclusive variants in two or more tumors from the same patient. Class informing indicates that the mutations arose in patients in which LymphGen classification matched the class association of the acquired variants. **C.** Patient LymphGen classifications stratified according to associated low-grade lymphoma entities. Transformed indicates low-grade disease preceded the first DLBCL diagnosis, while *de novo* indicates that the low-grade diagnosis was made after DLBCL diagnosis. **D.** A model of the relationship between relapse timing, evolutionary patterns, and outcomes.
